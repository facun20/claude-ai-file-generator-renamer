- **Content Extraction**: Reads text from Word documents, PDFs, and analyzes filenames for other file types
- **Smart Fallback**: Works even when AI analysis is unavailable
- **File Collision Prevention**: Handles naming collisions automatically
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Select files to rename with easy checkboxes
- **Detailed Logs**: See exactly what's happening during the process

## Naming Convention

The tool follows a standard naming convention for files:

```
Subject_Description_DocumentForm_YYYYMMDD_Rev#.extension
```

Where:
- **Subject**: The main topic/department (e.g., "Finance")
- **Description**: What the document is about, in CamelCase (e.g., "QuarterlyReport")
- **DocumentForm**: A three-letter code indicating document type (e.g., "RPT" for Report)
- **Date**: Format YYYYMMDD (e.g., "20240515")
- **Revision**: Version status (e.g., "Rev0" for final, "RevA" for draft)

### Document Form Codes

Common document form codes include:
- **RPT**: Report
- **MEM**: Memo
- **FRM**: Form
- **MKT**: Marketing
- **IMG**: Image
- **DAT**: Data
- **DOC**: Document
- **PRO**: Proposal
- **GUI**: Guidelines

## Privacy & Security

- Your API key is never stored and only used for the current session
- Files are processed locally on your computer
- Only file content is sent to Claude for analysis (no metadata)
- Claude's analysis is performed through secure API calls

## Customization

You can customize the document form codes by modifying the `DOCUMENT_FORMS` dictionary at the top of the script:

```python
DOCUMENT_FORMS = {
    "RPT": "Report",
    "MEM": "Memo",
    # Add your custom codes here
}
```
